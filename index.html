                    <p>Today marks another year of your beautiful life, and though I cannot be there to celebrate with you in person, know that my love surrounds you always. From wherever I am, I watch over you with such pride and joy.</p>
                    
                    <p>You have grown into such a wonderful father and husband. The way you care for your family, the gentleness in your voice when you speak to your children, the strength you show in difficult times - all of this makes my heart swell with pride. You are everything I hoped you would become and so much more.</p>
                    
                    <p>I remember when you were just a little boy, how you would follow me around the kitchen, always curious, always eager to help. That same caring spirit lives on in you today. You've passed it on to your own children, and I see glimpses of the little boy you were in their bright eyes and loving hearts.</p>
                    
                    <p>On this special day, July 25th, I want you to know that every prayer I ever said for you has been answered. You are loved beyond measure, not just by me, but by everyone whose life you've touched. Your kindness, your wisdom, your gentle strength - these are the gifts you give to the world every day.</p>
                    
                    <p>Celebrate today knowing that you are cherished, that your life has meaning and purpose, and that the love we share transcends any distance. Dance a little, laugh a lot, and feel the warmth of all the birthday wishes surrounding you.</p>

                        Happy Birthday, my precious son.<br>
