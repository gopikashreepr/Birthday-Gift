                                Today we celebrate not just another year of your life, but another year of the incredible impact you've had on all of us. You are the foundation of our family, the source of our strength, and the reason we know what unconditional love truly means.
                            </p>

                                Your gentle guidance, your warm hugs, your silly jokes that make us laugh even when we don't want to - these are the treasures that make you so special. You've taught me what it means to be kind, to be strong, and to always lead with love.
                            </p>

                                Every memory we've created together is a gift I carry in my heart. From bedtime stories to life lessons, from celebrating my victories to comforting me through challenges - you've been my constant, my hero, my Appa.

                                I know Amma is smiling down on us today, so proud of the wonderful father you are and the beautiful family we've become. Her love lives on through you, through us, and through all the ways you continue to make the world a better place.
